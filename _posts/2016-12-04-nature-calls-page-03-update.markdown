[Monday's update is out! Get it while it's hot!](/comics/nature+calls_03/)

Now the joke's starting. This comic was supposed to be a super funny one! I say "supposed" to be because when you work as long and hard on these stories as I have, time and space and emotions lose all meaning as you resign yourself to the void.

Happy Monday!
