[Thursday's update is out! Things are heating up!](/comics/nature+calls_04/)

Hm. Last time I said "get it while it's hot," and this time I'm saying "things are heating up." Seems a little anachronistic, right?

Or maybe time is just nonlinear and this is how I'm teaching you that. Maybe this is how two discrete points of the four-dimensional spacetime object that is reality are communicating right now. Maybe information flows without regard to cause and effect. Maybe all things always have been and never were.

Happy Thursday!
