[Thursday's update is out!](/comics/nature+calls_06/)

There's only one update left in "Nature Calls" after this, coming on Monday. After that, we'll be taking a two-week break for the holidays. We'll be back on&nbsp;**January 2nd, 2017&nbsp;**with the&nbsp;**first-ever joint Racia AND Antau (RACIANTAU) story, "Desperate Times"!**

But for now, enjoy these last pages!
