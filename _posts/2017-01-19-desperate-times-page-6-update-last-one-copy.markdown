[Desperate Times is over! Last page is here!](/comics/desperate+times_06/)

Phase One is over, too! What does that mean? A great question! It means that Phase Two starts next Monday with a new Racia story, "I Live in a Senseless Town"! And we're updating every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from now on! See you then!
