[Friday's update's out now!](/comics/cabin+fever_09/)

Yeah, we missed yesterday's update. Fortunately, that should be the last time something like that ever happens again! We've finally got an automated updating program in place to catch anything that slips through the cracks.

That said, putting down a marker like this is just asking for trouble, ain't it? Late capitalism is defined by "technical difficulties."

Well. Why don't we all just agree to forget that sadness and go enjoy the new page!
