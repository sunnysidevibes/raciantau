[Here it isâ€¦ Your Monday update. Go read it. This page is darker than the last one we told you about but it's okay, you can still have fun, you are in charge of your own fun.](/comics/cabin+fever_07/)

We totally forgot to be updating these blog posts. The Rock and I totally dropped the ball on that. Less the Rock, because they've got a new job and are much busier now, but then also you know what, less me, because the Rock didn't tell me anything about it until over this past weekend. So now that the blame has been properly allotted, welcome back!

Oh man. Gonna have to keep these updates shorter than the blurbs. Okay. Shutting up. Nnnnnnnn

owwww.
