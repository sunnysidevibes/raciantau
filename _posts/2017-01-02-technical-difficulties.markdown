As a little note for your convenience: there are some technical difficulties around the site today! Our webmaster Rock is slightly out of commission. So there are troubles with the new "Desperate Times" Archives, and as you may have noticed, we're struggling to get the old Christmas image visible. These things will be fixed in the upcoming changes! And hey look, our first news post!

The times, how they change!

Did you know some douchebag once said writers should take out exclamation points, because it's the same as laughing at your own jokes?

Probably was right on that.&nbsp;
