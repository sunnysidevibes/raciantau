desc_html: "<p>Racia and Antau join forces once more in our capstone on civics. In the distant future Earth is so covered in crap no one wants to deal with it anymore, so humanity turns starward to start anew on Mars. Whatever obstacles stand against us we'll always look forward and move onward, bouyed by our greatest ideals: ingenuity, community, and above all else, freedom. 30 pages in two parts.</p>"
