<h3>Translation by Harold T. Roth</h3>

<h2>I</h2>
<p>The vital essence of all things:</p>
<p>It is this that brings them to life.</p>
<p>It generates the five grains below</p>
<p>And becomes the constellations above.</p>
<p>When flowing amid the heavens and the earth</p>
<p>We call it ghostly and numinous.</p>
<p>When stored within the chests of human beings,</p>
<p>We call them sages.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>Therefore the vital energy is:</p>
<p>Bright! - as if ascending the heavens;</p>
<p>Dark! - as if entering an abyss;</p>
<p>Vast! - as if dwelling in an ocean;</p>
<p>Lofty! - as if dwelling on a mountain peak.</p>
<br />
<p>Therefore this vital energy</p>
<p>Cannot be halted by force,</p>
<p>Yet can be secured by inner power <em>[Te]</em>.</p>
<p>Cannot be summoned by speech,</p>
<p>Yet can be welcomed by the awareness.</p>
<p>Reverently hold onto it and do not lose it:</p>
<p>This is called "developing inner power."</p>
<p>When inner power develops and wisdom emerges,</p>
<p>The myriad things will, to the last one, be grasped.</p>

<h2>III</h2>  
<p>All the forms of the mind</p>
<p>Are naturally infused and filled with it [the vital essence],</p>
<p>Are naturally generated and developed [because of] it.</p>
<p>It is lost</p>
<p>Inevitably because of sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desrie, and profit-seeking.</p>
<p>If you are able to cast off sorrow, happiness, joy, anger, desrie, and profit-seeking,</p>
<p>Your mind will just revert to equanimity.</p>
<p>The true condition of the mind</p>
<p>Is that it finds calmness beneficial and, by it, attains repose.</p>
<p>Do not disturb it, do not disrupt it</p>
<p>And harmony will naturally develop.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<p>Clear! as though right by your side.</p>
<p><Vague! as though it will not be attained./p>
<p>Indiscernable! as though beyond the limitless.</p>
<p>The test of this is not far off:</p>
<p>Daily we make use of its inner power.</p>
<p>The Way is what infuses the body,</p>
<p>Yet people are unable to fix it in place.</p>
<p>It goes forth but does not return,</p>
<p>It comes back but does not stay.</p>
<p>Silent! none can hear its sound.</p>
<p>Suddenly stopping! it abides within the mind.</p>
<p>Obscure! we do not see its form.</p>
<p>Surging forth! it arises with us.</p>
<p>We do not see it form,</p>
<p>We do not hear its sound,</p>
<p>Yet we can perceive an order to its accomplishments.</p>
<p>We call it "the Way."</p>
  
<h2>V</h2>
<p>The Way has no fixed position;</p>
<p>It abides within the excellent mind.</p>
<p>When the mind is tranquil and the vital breath is regular,</p>
<p>The Way can thereby be halted.</p>
<p>That Way is not distant from us;</p>
<p>When people attain it they are sustained</p>
<p>That Way is not separated from us;</p>
<p>When people accord with it they are harmonious.</p>
<br />
<p>Therefore: Concentrated! as though you could be roped together with it.</p>
<p>Indiscernable! as though beyond all locations.</p>
<p>The true state of that Way:</p>
<p>How could it be conceived of and pronounced upon?</p>
<p>Cultivate you mind, make your thoughts tranquil,</p>
<p>And the Way can thereby be attained.</p>
