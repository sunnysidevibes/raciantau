<h3>Translation by Harold T. Roth</h3>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>The vital essence of all things:</p>
<p>It is this that brings them to life.</p>
<p>It generates the five grains below</p>
<p>And becomes the constellations above.</p>
<p>When flowing amid the heavens and the earth</p>
<p>We call it ghostly and numinous.</p>
<p>When stored within the chests of human beings,</p>
<p>We call them sages.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>Therefore the vital energy is:</p>
<p>Bright! - as if ascending the heavens;</p>
<p>Dark! - as if entering an abyss;</p>
<p>Vast! - as if dwelling in an ocean;</p>
<p>Lofty! - as if dwelling on a mountain peak.</p>
<br />
<p>Therefore this vital energy</p>
<p>Cannot be halted by force,</p>
<p>Yet can be secured by inner power <em>[Te]</em>.</p>
<p>Cannot be summoned by speech,</p>
<p>Yet can be welcomed by the awareness.</p>
<p>Reverently hold onto it and do not lose it:</p>
<p>This is called "developing inner power."</p>
<p>When inner power develops and wisdom emerges,</p>
<p>The myriad things will, to the last one, be grasped.</p>
