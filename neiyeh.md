<h2>Nei-Yeh</h2>
<h3>Translation by Harold T. Roth</h3>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>The vital essence of all things:</p>
<p>It is this that brings them to life.</p>
<p>It generates the five grains below</p>
<p>And becomes the constellations above.</p>
<p>When flowing amid the heavens and the earth</p>
<p>We call it ghostly and numinous.</p>
<p>When stored within the chests of human beings,</p>
<p>We call them sages.</p>
