Sometimes we catch ourselves using words/phrases like "just a cartoon(ist)," which is a real shame because we don't really believe in that "just a" formulation back here. In fact, we take a bit of pride in the fact that the default **cuteness** of *RACIANTAU&nbsp;*allows for the, ahh ...&nbsp;*tension&nbsp;*you see above.
