I was gonna open this blurb by saying, “Ah, the classic Brexit case,” but … that just happened. Isn't it sort of incredible how quickly things in our society become “classic”?

It's clearly not just because of the 24/7 news cycle, although that has played its role in the changes. It's digital society as a whole, I think; we can consume so much information so quickly and we all do it together, on the same (largely) public forum. We talk about it as we talk to each other almost non-stop, all day, all week, so that something that happened six months ago can feel like a law of nature, something you were born doing.

Everyone reading this probably knows what I'm talking about, whether you agree or not. I'm not here to talk about that, though. It just makes me think.

When I was a kid I totally thought, “Life is like a box of chocolates,” was an aphorism that had existed since basically forever, and even when I heard it in *Forrest Gump* I thought they were just using that normal English phrase. It wasn't until much later that it was made clear to me *Forrest Gump* originated the phrase. It's interesting, I think – the way our perceptions influence our world. What we think is true. What we're willing to accept from others.
