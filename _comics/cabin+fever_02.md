“They” say, “Write what you know,” and like most “true” statements there are a lot of possible interpretations of that line. I've always taken it to mean that you ought to be writing things you know to be <em>true</em>; you know, the way horror writers and filmmakers tell stories about things they know scare them?

They <em>know</em> the story they're peddling is scary because it is <em>scary to them</em>. Obviously it might not work for others; but nothing you ever do will <b>always</b> work for others, so that shouldn't be a primary consideration.

Anyway. I've been afraid of death-by-falling for most of my life. For most of my life airplane travel <em>felt</em> different, more safe for some reason; I would only really be “afraid of heights” when I was right up at the edge of one. The strange pull one feels at a cliffside, the knowledge that one step more and it'd be too late to do anything else …

Those feelings aren't what we're talking about in “Cabin Fever.” Don't worry, shhh. That's a <em>secret</em>.
