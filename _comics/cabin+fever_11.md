Whew. There's really nothing to say about this page, is there?

Haha, joke's on you, there's totally stuff to say about this page! I don't think it took any longer to work on this page than a “normal” page of *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;and, in fact, it may actually have taken **less**&nbsp;time than usual, but it *suuure*&nbsp;didn't feel that way. Working inside panel limitations helps break up your work and offers a natural way to mark your own progress.

On a big page like this things can seem a little overwhelming. You figure out ways to break it up on your own anyhow but … there's tricks and there's tools, and then there's reality. Does that make sense? Well … it does to me.

I love this page for a lot of reasons but I think listing off most of them might actually be counterproductive. Sometimes you can't show people behind the curtain; as an artist you should always be proud of your work, but there comes a time you recognize some things work better with a little dash of mystery. Even if your audience can't see any mystery at all. Maybe *especially*&nbsp;at those times.
