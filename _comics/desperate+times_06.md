Do you recognize the inspiration for these trees? NEEEERRRno, it was a pretty fun game, it's okay, I'm a nerd, too.

That's it for "Desperate Times," and Phase One as a whole! There aren't any breaks on this train anymore, though. Come back next **Monday** on **January 23rd** for the next Racia story, "I Live in a Senseless Town," which starts out Phase Two, *Civics*!

From now on, by the way, **we'll be updating every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.** So make sure to stick around! Things are speeding up! There's nowhere to go but forward!
