This page feels pretty busy! So does the next one. Don't worry – that's the point!

I think I'll stop saying “that's the point” so much. It will take effort. I read a *lot* of media criticism (not so much academic criticism as popcorn blogging criticism nowadays). I tend to get the sense from most contemporary critics that anything that feels slightly uncomfortable or human or weird or … *off* is “bad.”

If you've been following these blurbs a lot, you'll know by now that I don't approach my own storytelling that way (nor do I consume other stories with that sort of mentality). Sometimes I *want* to be made uncomfortable. Sometimes I can tell an author or artist **didn't** want me to feel uncomfortable but I do anyway, and that's great, too.

Anyway, I'm not here to tell you how to feel about the art. This was a fun page to work on though; the first page during the production process I completed, so although the style (white geometric shapes acting as “panels” over an unbroken black background) was first seen in the *previous* page, this was the page that convinced me it would work over the course of a comic.
