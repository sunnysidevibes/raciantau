What goes around comes around.

So concludes the second Antau story! Thank you so much for your continued support; we do this for, and you guys make it worth it!

Come back next Monday, April 3rd, for the start of Phase 2's last story, our RACIANTAU capstone: "MARS FREEDOM COLONY!" It will be divided into three parts of 10 pages each, making it as long as this Phase's Racia and Antau stories combined, and five times as long as last Phase's "DESPERATE TIMES"!

There are no brakes on this train! That's dangerous! Someone call an engineer! But until then, please continue to enjoy our stories and tell your families, tell your friends!
