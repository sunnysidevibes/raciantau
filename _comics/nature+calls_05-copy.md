“Talk of mysteries! - Think of our life in nature, - daily to be shown matter, to come in contact with it, - rocks, trees, wind on our cheeks! The [i]solid[/i] earth! the [i]actual[/i] world! the [i]common sense! Contact! Contact! Who[/i] are we? [i]where[/i] are we?”
<br>-Thoreau, The Maine Woods, Ktaadn Pt 6

What is there to say? Words feel hollow.

I want you to laugh. More than that, too. Something lonely.

Matsuo Basho wrote something like, “Sabi is the color of the poem. It does not necessarily refer to the poem that describes a lonely scene. If a man goes to war wearing stout armour or to a party dressed up in gay clothes, and if this man happens to be an old man, there is something lonely about him. Sabi is something like that.”
