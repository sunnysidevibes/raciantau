Ahh, Mrs. Fox. What you may suspect is a weird gag and reference to Fox News is, in fact, an *internal* reference I am making to an old series of one-panel comics I made a while back called *Mrs. Fox and Friends*. Mrs. Fox was the main character, of course. There were two other main characters, Mr Owl and Mr Snake. Yes, Mrs. Fox is spelled with a “.” and Mrs Owl and Snake are not. It was a stylistic choice.

I'm pretty confident a majority of people reading this comic think they know the sort of behavior I'm condemning in this strip. I think the fact that a lot of those people wouldn't actually agree on what's being condemned is interesting, yeah? I really do think that's *more* interesting than hearing me explicitly describe what's being condemned.

Anyone can condemn behavior. A lot of people do, and I'm not even saying I'm against it. But hearing one more voice (my own) condemn what you want to hear condemned doesn't *change* anything.

Neither, to be fair, does wondering about the difficulties, maybe even **impossibilities** of true understanding and meaningful conflict resolution. But in my little bear heart, it *feels* like a more valuable endeavor.
