Welcome (again) to "I Live in a Senseless Town," the first Racia story in a while and the first story ever in <i>RACIANTAU</i>'s Phase Two: Civics! It's exciting to be back and hitting the ground running. Lots of changes around the site now, but since these blurbs have gone through the Great Shortening, we might just make a blog post separately to jot those all down. In any case, we hope you're as excited to take this journey as we are to send you on it!
