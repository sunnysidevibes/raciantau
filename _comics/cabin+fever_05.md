I had one real nagging issue as I approached the end of “Battlemon” production: although I knew who Racia was and so, by extension, understood what she was thinking and feeling throughout the text, I realized that to someone who *didn't*&nbsp;know these things it could possibly feel as though Racia wasn't **doing**&nbsp;much in the story.

And yeah, that's not the sort of thing I could go back to “fix” - it's also not something I'd consider worth “fixing,” because I don't think it's “broken.” That's the sort of story “Battlemon” was *intended*&nbsp;to be.

That said I'm happy to be following up that story on Racia's side with this one, because it does a great job of showing who Racia truly is: someone who, on the inside, never stops thinking. It also shows that thought process to be somewhat disjointed, making wild leaps and bounds, with a slightly pessimistic edge and an obsession with facing difficult issues.

Is that a spoiler? I don't think so, though it could possibly be “telling you how to feel about the character.” I don't think it's that, either, though … it's more just a summary of what should be pretty obvious by this point in the text.

“Cabin Fever” is also much more representative of the Racia stories to come, so this won't be a one-off sort of thing. Looking forward to that day.

Page is pretty dark, hunh? Yeesh.
