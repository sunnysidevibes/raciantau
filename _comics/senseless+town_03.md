Oh snap is&nbsp;*RACIANTAU&nbsp;*getting&nbsp;**political**? Trick question! We already did that way back in ["Collision 2016."](/comics/cabin+fever_01/)&nbsp;Anyway, "the planet is flooding" is less a&nbsp;*political statement&nbsp;*and more a&nbsp;*fact*. And whoever said&nbsp;*RACIANTAU&nbsp;*takes place on Earth, anyhow?
