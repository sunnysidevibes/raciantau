When we realized we basically hadn't used dot-tones as shading since [Battlemon](/comics/battlemon-01/) (we used lines for shading in [Nature Calls](/comics/nature+calls_01/) but … but … anyway) we told our editor, "Hey, we're gonna bring back dot-tones for shading in 'Senseless Town'." And they were like, "Cool." How's that for a peek behind the curtain?
