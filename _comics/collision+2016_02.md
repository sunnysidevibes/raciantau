Welcome back to Strip 02 of “Collision 2016”! As a reminder, Racia's introductory story (“Battlemon”) finishes today with <b>two updates</b>, so now's a great time to read it <a href='/comics/battelmon-01/'>straight through from the beginning!</a>.

I'm not going to comment much on these strips. I know I said that a lot in the blurbs for “Battlemon,” and then usually went on to comment pretty extensively, but I've learned a lot since then. Not really, that was a lie. It's just … these are all four-panel gag comics. If I need to be explaining anything about them, they were total failures.

I'll talk about politics a little down here, though. Vaguely. This is a “political comic,” and you can read Giant Meteor and the role Antau is playing as being some commentary on whatever politician you like, but that was intentional and I secretly am still winning this game. I had some clear ideas of what I was trying to say when I first wrote this comic, but by the time these are getting published I stand convinced that Giant Meteor (and its campaign in general) serves as a real indictment of functionally all electoral politics and, especially, what it's become in modern-day America.

Sort of tangential, but I'm tired of feeling like I need to pick sides. I think a lot of us feel that way right now? Personally, I think it's because I spent a lot of years fighting for a cause that something pretending toward “community” told me was the <em>cause du jour</em>. The logic behind what we were doing always made sense. It wasn't until recently that I realized that during those long years of being asked to be on one side or the other, no one was really making an affirmative case that they were on <em>my</em> side. No one out there still is; the issues <em>I</em> care about still aren't being discussed. So I retreat, write, draw. We all find ways to make in this life. It's the best, I think, we can do.
