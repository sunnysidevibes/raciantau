A fun page to draw. The eyes in the left column remind me of the full-screen color faces from Nick Jr. Gosh, I remember Nick Jr. What a time to be alive.

I guess they probably still do that. I dunno. It has, believe it or not, been a <em>while</em> since I watched Nick Jr.

I heard some feedback that the top half of this page is a little confusing â€“ the order you're meant to read the panels in isn't entirely clear. I thought that myself, when I was staring at the finished product. Then I tried the first three orders that naturally came to mind and basically felt all those interpretations did the work I needed that part of the page to do. So, left it as is. Note to aspiring artists: never give yourself more work than you need to.
