The first page of RACIANTAU and "Battlemon." It's been a long road getting here, and maybe I'll even tell that story some day. For now, though, we all know why you're here, and it's not to read what I have to say. Well, no, it is, but it's to … Like, also with what I've draw-- … Just, read the comic. The page on the other side. Why are you still reading this?

Oh my god, I've never met a more contrarian person in my life. Is this really how we're gonna start our relationship? What a power play. Well, that's alright. I look for that in a partner, anyway. <strike>Winky.</strike> ;)
