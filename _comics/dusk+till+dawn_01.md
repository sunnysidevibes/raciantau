Welcome to the capstone story for RACIANTAU's third anthology, "Ethics!" This is going to be our longest story to date, and unlike "MARS FREEDOM COLONY" there is no division into multiple parts.

Strap in, because we're planning on making the next three months an incredibly wild ride!

A note on coloring; we're not pivoting toward a full-color comic starting with this story! RACIANTAU is still "pinkscale," don't you worry!
