A new character! Although we saw her on the last page, this is her full introduction. Behind the scenes we call her "Piel," short for "Piel y Huesos" which is Spanish for "Skin and Bones." That's not her "actual name," though. The creepy hand in the speech bubble toward the end of the page doesn't sound like "Piel" when spoken. You can imagine what it actually sounds like.
