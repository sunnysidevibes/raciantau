I shouldn't have to spell this out for anyone, but "Nuzzledarns" are the all-black-with-white-defining-lines Pluto looking things. "Ratkas" are the blind swordsman mice. Oh; that's a little wooden stick the Ratka's swinging in the first panel.

Battlemon fights playing on the subway basically at all times, every advertisement for some Battlemon Co. product (or a product from one of its subsidiaries), everyone wearing Battlelets ... this society is obsessed with Battlemon. Just like in the Pokemon world. And in ours, now, too, because of Pokemon Go! Topical reference, check. We continue, undaunted, to create a historical record for those who will come after us, picking through the bones of our long-dead civilization. <em>What did they like?</em> they will ask themselves. <em>What made them tick?</em>

And the dust in the wind will whisper, "Pokemon Go."
