Nicknames are cute, if you care.<br><br>The way the bars of the birdcage obscure the Boss's combover to showcase his true baldness were unintentional, but happily so, as I like the way it denigrates him with the humility of a look he's desperately trying to avoid, since otherwise he looks rather cute, because I am incapable of intentionally drawing uncute things.<br><br>Seriously, in the storyboards he was supposed to look like a middle-aged sleazy car salesman. Where oh where did it all go wrong.<br><br>And he's still sorta cute in that panel if you, like, care, AHHH, what a hassle.
