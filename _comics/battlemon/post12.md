Holy shit, it's Antau! Technically this is the second time we're seeing him, since any observant ... observer might've noticed he was the coworker telling Racia to go speak with their boss, back on Page 5.

Racia and Antau both look more adult here than they probably will look in other stories; that's because the structure of this narrative wouldn't make sense with them in their more common young teenager looks, and the setting they're in lends itself well to a slight ambiguity or ... elasticity? Flexibility in age and appearance. Saying much more would probably technically be a spoiler, although maybe only in retrospect. Whatever. Doesn't matter.

The boss wasn't kidding when he said Racia was an excellent employee, apparently. They gave her a plaque and everything!
