Don't have much to say about this page. Don't want to. Ought to stand on its own.

I will say that as I made pages like this I couldn't stop hearing George Lucas saying shit about "rhyming," which put a damper on the creative process, but SHRUG. Attacking George Lucas is some low-hangin' fruit, y'know.
