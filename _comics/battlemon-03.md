I'm still not entirely sure what to do with this space. Comment entirely on the page? Talk about my own "what-passes-for-a-life," like webcomic blurbs used to back in <em>MY</em> day? Act as a sort of historical archive for some underpaid graduate student of the future?<br><br>I guess let's just focus on supplementary comic text for now. "Solutions" are the Battlemon world's counterpart to "potions"; "Battlemon Co." is its counterpart to "Silph Co.", which is the large corporation from the first two generations of Pokemon (for the uninitiated). Pokemon is a series of games in which the player controls a child avatar who turns out to be just the best goshdarned Pokemon Trainer there ever was without even really working too hard at it (cont. for the uninitiated).<br><br><strong>Rock</strong> said "The speech bubble in the last frame looks like a sea urchin hovering over the floor," and I said, "Hey, up yours, man," so it was a productive conversations. I give it a 7.8 / 10.
