This page excites me.

The storyboards for it were very exciting, and so was scripting it and working on it. But I don't want to talk about the art in particular. I don't have much to say about it. In fact the art on this page isn't even close to my favorite art for “Nature Calls,” if I had to make an ordered list of each panel. But I won't go into that. I still feel something for this page that isn't love or loyalty or pride and maybe has no name. Still it drives me to speak about it, still it hides itself from me.

We can talk about philosophy some other time. I've quoted lots leading up to this moment and I'll go back to quoting in the next pages. No, if you're here to listen to me, please scroll back up and read the page again. For once let's both let the art speak.
