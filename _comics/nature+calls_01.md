Welcome to “Nature Calls,” *RACIANTAU*'s second Antau story and, for those of you who've peeked at the Archives section of this new site, the last “solo” story before our two titular characters meet up in the forthcoming “Desperate Times”! But that's getting a bit ahead of ourselves, and it's important to center oneself – in the moment and in the body. Which, you know, reminds me ...

Since launching *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;and by extension the *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;blurb, I've worried now and then if the phrase “keeping to the **CENTER**” might be misunderstood by some. Writing this now, I realize that was a silly worry; of **course**&nbsp;some will misunderstand what we meant by that, it is *literally impossible*&nbsp;that that wouldn't be the case. Well, since art ought to stand on its own, let's take this time to instead tease out the philosophical concept *RACIANTAU*'s trying to explore. Don't worry – it's useful to know these things going into all these stories, but especially this one.

Modern Western cultures have a certain idea of what it means to be “moderate” and “center” and it usually means “between the political/cultural right and left, either borrowing ideas from both or taking a position of compromise betwixt.” And that's fine, sure, makes sense, whatever. But when we here at *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;use words like “moderation” or “holding to the center,” we mean something closer this passage from one of my favorite translations of the [*Tao Te Ching*](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/taote-v3.html#59):

> **59**
>
>
> [...]
>
>
> The mark of a moderate man
> <br>is freedom from his own ideas.
> <br>Tolerant like the sky,
> <br>all-pervading like sunlight,
> <br>firm like a mountain,
> <br>supple like a tree in the wind,
> <br>he has no destination in view
> <br>and makes use of anything
> <br>life happens to bring his way.

Here it's probably useful to say this translation of the *Tao Te Ching*&nbsp;is not without its critics. I'd suggest you go read what they have to say. I'd also suggest you read multiple translations of any text not originally written in your native tongue. More than anything, though, I'd suggest you let go of any faith or allegiance to authority and tradition. You're alone in this world. Trust and focus inward and on yourself. You can find something like real freedom and peace that way.

Thanks again for showing up! And tune in this Thursday for Page 02!
