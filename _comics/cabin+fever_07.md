A calmer page. When I first finished this it was odd to look at. The last five pages were so dynamic there was an almost inevitable adjustment period going into this one.

Still, there's a lot going on this page. Visually, ethically.

For a while, I've been fascinated with the idea of situations that force the necessity of cannibalism on folks. Usually I go back to reading up on the Donner Party and the 1972 Andes flight disaster. I want to make it clear that I'm fascinated by the idea of the [ital]situations[/ital] and the [ital]necessity[/ital], [bold]NOT[/bold] the “cannibalism.” I want to make that clear because it feels too easy for a certain type of person to focus on the lurid nature of the taboo we're discussing and not hear what's actually being said.

We all have a sort of gut reaction, almost definitely culturally implanted, that cannibalism is wrong. Even if you don't have an ethical obligation against cannibalism (which is rare), there are good medical reasons to avoid it. The here isn't to talk about cannibalism, it's to talk about what you do once you've found yourself functionally [ital]obligated[/ital] to do something wrong.

Put more simply, if there is a “point” to “Cabin Fever” it ain't on Page 06, it's on Page 07.

I'd like to think none of these [ital]RACIANTAU[/ital] stories have “a” “point,” though.
