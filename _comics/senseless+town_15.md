As always, thank you *so much* for reading! We couldn't do this without you all. Come back on Monday (2/27) for the next Antau story, "His Story Repeats Itself!" Following in the pattern we've established so far, that one's gonna lean more toward "comedy." We hope you'll enjoy it! We'll be shaking up that "formula" pretty soon here, so don't get too comfortable.
