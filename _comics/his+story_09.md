The storyboards for this comic were a bit more ambitious than, in retrospect, it was wise to be. That's the sort of thing you can read more about on our [patreon feed](https://www.patreon.com/fabelaro) for as little as $1 a month!

I still love this page. And as a prelude of things to come it is sublime.
