The original plan for night and otherwise dark scenes was to have white outlines around objects, and as you can see throughout this page we largely stuck with that plan, but I'm also a huge fan of what Racia's hair looks like against a solid black background.

I'm a huge fan of Racia's expression in panels 3 and 8. Really like how Bunners came out in panel 3, too. And I like the yawning face on this page and back in Page 5. I think my favorite part of this page is the overall structure of the bottom row, though. When I first pitched it to the webmaster he wasn't sure it would work, but he later ate his words and I just laughed and laughed. Ah ha. Ha.

What sorta Battlemon is this freaked out by battles? Well, to be fair, it's not like the species named itself. Or ... not "species," really, since that would suggest they can all interbreed and that's not even entirely true for Pokemon. Genera? Whatever. No one cares about science. Hear that, future historians/digital archaeologists?? NONE OF US CARED ABOUT SCIENCE
