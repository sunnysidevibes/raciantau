More supplementary text: that's toilet paper wrapped around Bunners. Have I mentioned the little Battlemon's name is Bunners, yet? Might be burying the lede there. Hrm. Her species' name is Niahare, from the word "hare" and from the name "Nia," the love interest from <em>Gurren Lagann</em>, who I think is a big ole cutie.<br><br>That's all I got. Uhhh. How are <em>you</em> doing today?
