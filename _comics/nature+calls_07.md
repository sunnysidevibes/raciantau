And that's all there is for “Nature Calls,” a haiku and another colored page.

If you've been to the [Archives](/archives/), you'll know Phase One is called “Protasis” and you'll *also*&nbsp;know it's just about done. There's one more story to go, "Desperate Times." It's the first true *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;story; Antau's shown up in Racia's first story, [“Battlemon,”](/comics/battlemon-05/)&nbsp;his presence was negligible; he didn't *matter*. In this upcoming story they're *both&nbsp;*the lead; hence, “RACIANTAU” (I call these Phase-ending stories starring both of them "capstones").

When Phase Two starts up they'll be off to their solo stories again; but not for long, and Phase Two's capstone is *much&nbsp;*longer than "Desperate Times." But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

I hope you enjoyed “Nature Calls” as much as I enjoyed sharing it with you all! Like a lot of outfits out there,&nbsp;*RACIANTAU&nbsp;*will be taking a two-week break starting now. Enjoy the holidays, such as they are, and whatever vacation time you may or may not have between now and **Monday, January 2nd**, when we'll start updating again on&nbsp;**Mondays** and **Thursdays**. The *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;journey is **literally**&nbsp;just getting started and we're excited to have you along for the ride!
