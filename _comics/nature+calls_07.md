And that's all there is for “Nature Calls.” We end on a poem and another color page.

If you've been looking at the [Archives](/archives/), you'll know Phase One is called “Protasis” and you'll *also*&nbsp;know it's just about done. There's one more story to go, "Desperate Times." (I call those Phase-ending joint Racia and Antau stories "capstones"). It's the first true *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;story; Antau's shown up in Racia's first story, “Battlemon,” but we never heard him speak **while**&nbsp;seeing his face other there. That'll be different in the next story, where both of them take the lead; hence, “RACIANTAU.”

When Phase Two starts up they'll be going their separate ways again to head their solo stories before meeting up again for a much longer story. But that's *really&nbsp;*getting ahead of ourselves.

I hope you enjoyed “Nature Calls”; I really enjoyed drawing it, really enjoyed writing these blurbs up, and really enjoy having you folks around! There's really not much more to say about this one, though, that wouldn't ruin the whole *point*&nbsp;of it with too much talking. I hope you had fun and we'll leave it at that.

We'll be taking a two week break before “Desperate Times” starts up. Enjoy the holidays, such as they are, and whatever vacation time you may or may not have between now and **Monday, January 2nd**, when we'll start updating again **Mondays** and **Thursdays**. The *RACIANTAU*&nbsp;journey is **literally**&nbsp;just getting started and we're so excited for the ride we're taking you on!
