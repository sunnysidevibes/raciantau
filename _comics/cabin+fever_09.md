That top panel came about pretty late in production (that is to say, the storyboard for this page looked rather different). Never be afraid to change course midstream if that's what your gut tells you to do! I won't say why I think this move was correct, though. That's partly because you don't know what the original storyboard was so it'd be lost on y'all, and partly because I'm learning how to not hold an audience's hand so much.

See, this is what folks tune in for. The *character growth*.

I love the bottom panel. We used a similar angle in the very last panel of “Battlemon,” you may recall (if you don't, have you reread “Battlemon” recently? It's always a great time to reread “Battlemon”).

Loving that sorta angle is a blessing and a curse, yeah? It's fun to come up with new things to do with a visual tool you love, exciting to see how you can keep your passions fresh, but it's also very tempting to fall into ruts. These are things we all have to avoid. As best we can, mm-hm, mm-hm.
