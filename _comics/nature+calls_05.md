> Talk of mysteries! - Think of our life in nature, - daily to be shown matter, to come in contact with it, - rocks, trees, wind on our cheeks! The ***solid***&nbsp;earth! the ***actual***&nbsp;world! the **common sense! Contact! Contact! Who**&nbsp;are we? ***where***&nbsp;are we?

What is there to say? Words feel hollow.

I want you to laugh. More than that, too. Something lonely.

Matsuo Basho [wrote something like](http://www.carlsensei.com/classical/index.php/translation/view/42),

> Sabi is the color of the poem. It does not necessarily refer to the poem that describes a lonely scene. If a man goes to war wearing stout armour or to a party dressed up in gay clothes, and if this man happens to be an old man, there is something lonely about him. Sabi is something like that.
