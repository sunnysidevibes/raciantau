There's an old saw, right, that most people are probably familiar with, goes like, "Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away." I heard some variation on that theme some time back and was really bothered by it, because my own personal philosophy suggested there was no way that wasn't true but my artistic experience suggested I had no idea how to actually execute that idea.

Arguably I still don't! Creative production is a journey we're all on and I don't know if any of us are actually good at it [except](http://www.octopuspie.com) [maybe](http://www.nedroid.com) [these](http://www.harkavagrant.com) [guys](http://www.bohemiandrive.com/).

That said, the artistic work done for RACIANTAU is all several orders less complicated than art I was producing immediately prior. The real goal, of course, is to make more and more pages like this, without any dialogue, that still carry a story. Well. I say "goal," but we'll see how things go.

Racia's face in the last panel, amirite? SURPRISE: they were real eyes the whoooole tiiiiime.
